# HTML Character Codes

This is a port of [this original list](http://www.evotech.net/blog/2007/04/named-html-entities-in-numeric-order/) and full credit goes to its author. It was moved to Wordpress and has since become unusable. So I quickly copied it over, tweaked it and made it pretty again.

Enjoy
